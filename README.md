##ReadMe.md## Technologies Used- **Framework:** Spring Boot- **Language:** Java- **Build Tool:** Maven## Data FlowThe URL Hit Counter application follows a structured data flow pattern to handle requests and manage data efficiently:## Controller :* This is a Spring REST Controller responsible for handling HTTP requests related to user management.* ###Endpoints:* GET /users: Retrieves a list of all users.* POST /users: Adds new users to the system.* PUT /user/id/{id}: Updates a user's name by their ID.* DELETE /user/id/{id}: Deletes a user by their ID.##Services: This is a Spring Service class responsible for implementing business logic related to user management. * getalluser(): Retrieves a list of all users.* adduser(List<User> user): Adds new users to the system.* updatenamebyid(Integer id, String name): Updates a user's name by their ID.*  deleteuser(Integer id): Deletes a user by their ID.## Repository :This class seems to be intended for handling user data, but it's currently autowiring a List<User>.## Data Structure Used:A List<User> is used to store and manage user objects.## Database Design:It appears that your application is using an in-memory List<User> as a placeholder for a database.##Project Summary:The project appears to be a simple Spring Boot application for user management, using a list-based data store.It includes endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.There is no actual database integration; instead, it uses an in-memory list to store user objects.Please note that the provided code is a starting point for a Spring Boot application, and you may need to configure your application further for database integration, error handling, and security, depending on your specific requirements. Additionally, the code assumes the existence of a User class, which you have included in your code but didn't provide its details.
